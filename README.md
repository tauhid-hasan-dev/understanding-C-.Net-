### Class and Object : 
```
- Variables inside the class but outside the object is called "MEMBER VARIABLE" or "INSTANCE VARIABLE"
- Variables inside the object called "LOCAL VARIABLE"
- A class can be created by a developer but can not be used by that same developer
- If a developer use that class to create instances we can call that developer "USER" or "CALLER"
